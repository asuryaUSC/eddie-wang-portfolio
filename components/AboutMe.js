        Hi I'm Eddie Wang! I'm a Business Administration student at USC, focusing on analytics and innovation, graduating in 2025. My passion lies in uncovering insights through data to improve business practices. When I'm not studying, I love thrifting, exploring new fitness regimes, and cooking up Szechuan dishes. I'm all about learning, growing, and applying my skills in meaningful ways.
